# The Python code to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series and print the result:

```python
# Define the number of terms
num_terms = 10000

# Initialize total to zero
total = 0

# Loop through the first 10,000 terms
for i in range(num_terms):
    # Calculate the denominator (odd numbers)
    denominator = 2 * i + 1
    # Calculate the term: 1/(2*i + 1) with alternating signs
    term = (-1)**i * (1 / denominator)
    # Add term to total
    total += term

# Multiply total by 4
final_result = total * 4

# Print the final result
print(final_result)
```
